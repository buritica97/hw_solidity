**Contract Motivation** 
The AssociateProfitSplitter contract will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This allows the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

Screen shots are included illustrating the following steps:
  1) Create a .sol file with the appropriate code for the contract. 
  2) Compile Contract (Screen_Shot1) -- look for a green check mark
  3) Deploy the Contract (Screen Shot2)
  4) Deploy the Contract Again (Screen_Shot3 & Screen_Shot4) -- look for buttons underneath the contract tab
  5) Verify Transaction using Ganache (Screen_Shot5 - Screen_Shot7) 

**Keep in Mind:** Make sure that Ganache is up and running before you attempt to interact with your contract.

Four short videos are also included in repo to further demonstrate what was done in order to build and execute the contract.
